# Hello there!

If you were invited to this by me, probably no reason to read this, just going over general purpose stuff. If you were NOT invited by me...
#### GET! GET OUT!! SHOO!

Just kidding, if someone else invited you, it's probably for a reason like you're competent or creative or talented... why would I suggest those off the top of my head? Because they're common! No! I'm competent! I think...

This is (hopefully) going to be used by kids without phones to chat with random people. I would therefore like to keep this as inexpensive as possible, and free to use as possible. Kids are broke. Harsh, but truer words have never been spoken.
