# Hello there!

If you were invited to this by me, probably no reason to read this, just going over general purpose stuff. If you were NOT invited by me...
#### GET! GET OUT!! SHOO!

Just kidding, if someone else invited you, it's probably for a reason like you're competent or creative or talented... why would I suggest those off the top of my head? Because they're common! No! I'm competent! I think...

Anyway, this is going to be a chatroom website, with these features going for it:
* Accounts
* General Chatrooms that anyone with an account can access
* And (if it doesn't require too much computer storage) the ability to PM (or DM) people

This is (hopefully) going to be used by kids without phones to chat with random people. I would therefore like to keep this as inexpensive as possible, and free to use as possible. Kids are broke. Harsh, but truer words have never been spoken.
