# Hello there

If you were invited to this by me, probably no reason to read this, just going over general purpose stuff. If you were NOT invited by me...
#### GET! GET OUT!! SHOO!

Just kidding, if someone else invited you, it's probably for a reason like you're competent or creative or talented... why would I suggest those off the top of my head? Because they're common! No! I'm competent! I think...


Anyway, this is going to be a chatroom website, with these features going for it:
* Accounts
* General Chatrooms that anyone with an account can access
* And (if it doesn't require too much computer storage) the ability to PM (or DM) people

I would like to keep this as inexpensive as possible, and there by free to use as possible.
